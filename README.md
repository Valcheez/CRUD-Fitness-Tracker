# CRUD-Fitness-Tracker


Description:

This CRUD project is intended to be used as a simple tracker for exercise workouts. Date, workout type, and exercises are the parameters that are tracked. 
This Flask app uses SQLite via SQLAlchemy as a relational database. Flask was used due to the minimal scale of this project.

I hope to improve this project as I advance my programming skills and knowledge.


How to install and run the Project:

Using visual studio codeâ€™s terminal:
1.	Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
2.	Activate the venv: venv\Scripts\activate.bat
3.	Install Flask and SQLAlchemy: pip install Flask
4.	To run: python -m flask run
